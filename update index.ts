Bug Fixes:
Error Handling in removeUser Function:

In the removeUser function, the deletion of posts and the removal of the user from the UserBase should be done within a transaction to ensure consistency. If an error occurs during the deletion of posts, the user might be removed without their posts being deleted.
Potential Issue in deletePost Function:

In the deletePost function, when filtering the posts of the creator to remove the deleted post, it would be safer to check for deletePostId to avoid potential issues if it's null or undefined.
Sorting in viewFlaggedPosts Function:

The sorting in the viewFlaggedPosts function seems to be in descending order. If you want it in ascending order, change the comparison in the sort function to x.reports - y.reports.
Security Fixes:
Transaction Security in removeUser:

Wrap the operations inside the removeUser function in a transaction to ensure that either all operations (unfollow, remove followers, and post deletion) succeed, or none of them do.
Sanitize User Input:

Consider validating and sanitizing user inputs, especially in functions like changeUsername and createUser, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
Code Improvements:
Consistent Error Handling:

Ensure consistent error handling throughout the code. For example, consistently use Some and None instead of 'Some' and 'None' for option types.
Refactor massUnfollow and massRemoveFollowers:

Consider refactoring massUnfollow and massRemoveFollowers to reduce code redundancy and improve readability. Extract common logic into helper functions if necessary.
Improve Comments:

Add or improve comments to explain complex logic, especially in functions that involve multiple steps or transactions.
